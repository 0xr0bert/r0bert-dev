<h1>Background</h1>

<section id="background-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is a growing commitment in the UK and worldwide to rebalancing
the travel system, so that more journeys are made using more active
modes, such as walking and cycling.</li>
<li>Walking and cycling are good for people’s physical and mental
health, but also, they reduce dependency on motorized transport,
particularly cars, which will reduce noise and air pollution, reduce the
risk of road traffic injury, and help cardiovascular disease and
obesity.</li>
<li>Therefore, there are significant population health gains to be made
by moving people into more active modes of travel.</li>
<li>Social norms, as well as system-based approaches, are understudied
in public health. However, these could be key to understanding what
makes an intervention successful.</li>
<li>By norms, we refer to emergent social norms, i.e., behaviour which
becomes prevalent through interaction, rather than prescriptive norms
(obligation, prohibition, and permission)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="model-aims" class="slide level2">
<h2>Model aims</h2>
<ul>
<li>The aim is to build a configurable agent-based model of the
<em>decision</em> to perform commuting behaviour.</li>
<li>This means that the actual process of commuting is not modelled – we
don’t model how traffic flows through cities.</li>
<li>We look at the higher-level mode-choice decision rather than the act
of travel.</li>
<li>We aim to include the effect of the actions of peers and neighbours,
subculture, habit, weather, bicycle ownership, car ownership,
environmental supportiveness, and congestion on the decision to travel
by walking, cycling, driving, or public transport.</li>
<li>All the parameters are configurable allowing for other users to
calibrate the model to their own area of interest.</li>

<h2>Some assumptions</h2>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<ul>
<li>4 options at every time step: walk, cycle, public transport, or
drive.</li>
<li>Modelled loosely on Waltham Forest, a North Eastern London
Borough.</li>
<li>Used a microsimulation approach to ensure wards (neighbourhoods)
matched real life on things such as car ownership and commute distance.
This used data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey <span

of Essex et al. 2020)</span> and 2011 Census population data <span

<section id="environmental-assumptions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Environmental assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each agent lives in a neighbourhood.
<ul>
<li>Neighbourhoods have a <em>supportiveness</em> for each transport
mode.</li>
<li>Neighbourhoods also have a physical <em>capacity</em> for each
transport mode, which once passed results in <em>congestion</em>, a
negative influence.</li>
<li>There is variation in neighbourhood supportiveness and capacity
between neighbourhoods.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Supportiveness is a <em>composite</em> configurable parameter.</li>
<li>We can change the score to reflect positive or negative changes in
the supportiveness of the environment.
<ul>
<li>Environmental changes are <em>low-frequency</em>, potentially
working through norms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We also allow for weather as a factor affecting daily mode choice.
<ul>
<li>Weather changes are <em>high-frequency</em>, imposing mode
choice.</li>
</ul></li>

</section>
<section id="agent-assumptions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Agent assumptions</h2>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<ul>
<li>Agents’ norms arise through a combination of:
<ul>
<li>their friends;</li>
<li>their neighbours; and</li>
<li>their mobility culture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A mobility culture could be seen as the process of creation and
maintenance of allegiance to particular forms of mobility.</li>
<li>The main task of an agent is to commute to work with a travel
mode.</li>

<section id="model-initialization" class="slide level2">
<h2>Model initialization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Agents are created and assigned a range of characteristics:
<ul>
<li>a commute to fulfil (local, city, or beyond);</li>
<li>a neighbourhood, social network, and mobility culture; and</li>
<li>some psychological variables:
<ul>
<li>suggestibility to friends and neighbours;</li>
<li>adherence to norms;</li>
<li>inertia/resistance to change; and</li>
<li>weather sensitivity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Neighbourhoods are assigned a supportiveness and capacity.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="a-model-run" class="slide level2">
<h2>A model run</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each agent goes to work every weekday.</li>
<li>Each weekday, each agent calculates a <em>budget</em> of how much
they are willing to commute by a given mode (norm + habit + congestion).
This is then ranked.</li>
<li>They also calculate a <em>cost</em> for each each mode (distance +
environmental supportiveness + weather). This is ranked in reverse
(higher cost = lower ranked cost).</li>
<li>Max of budget rank + reverse cost rank.</li>

<h2>Modelling car-free days</h2>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:45%;">
<ul>
<li>In order to demonstrate the utility of the model, we implemented an
intervention where cars were banned on Wednesdays.</li>
<li>After year 1, cars were banned. The simulation was run for 4 more
years.</li>
<li>This introduced greater instability into the journeys taken, but
significantly greater number of active commutes.</li>
<li>In the control scenario, over 200 runs, the odds of an active
journey were 0.091 (89% HPDI: [0.091, 0.091]). The odds of an active
journey were 77.7% (89% HPDI: [77.7%, 77.7%]) greater in the car-free
days scenario.</li>

<h1>Conclusion and end</h1>

</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="slide level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thinking about norms and habits are key.</li>
<li>In our sample intervention, habits and norms allow us to destabilize
the convention of commuting by car. We disrupt this convention by
preventing the effect of habit (on car-free days); this then leads to a
change in norm.</li>
<li>By allowing many runs of the simulation, precise estimates of the
effects within the model can be attained.</li>
<li>Further work could extend our model by calibrating the built
environment data to see how the environment interacts with social
norms.</li>
<li>The model is available under a permissive license at <a
href="https://gitlab.com/ragreener1/Motivate"
class="uri">https://gitlab.com/ragreener1/Motivate</a>. The specific
version used is available at <a href="https://doi.org/hvpd"
class="uri">https://doi.org/hvpd</a>. It is programmed in Rust, a modern
high-performance systems programming language.</li>
<li>The model is easily configurable using open standards (YAML) to
define its parametrization.</li>
