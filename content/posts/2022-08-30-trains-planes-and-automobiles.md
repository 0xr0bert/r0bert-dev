I recently took the train over 1200 km from Huntingdon in the East of England to Vienna in Austria (see my Twitter threads [here](https://twitter.com/ragreener1/status/1550005691808710661?s=20&t=9ANABg6xctLu19xxb5dGsg) and [here](https://twitter.com/ragreener1/status/1553234571692580865?s=20&t=9ANABg6xctLu19xxb5dGsg)).
This is a long journey.
On the outbound I went from Huntingdon to London (Great Northern), London to Amsterdam (Eurostar), Amsterdam to Vienna (√ñBB NightJet), taking over 24 hours.
On the return I went from Vienna to Frankfurt (DB ICE), Frankfurt to Brussels (DB ICE), Brussels to London (Eurostar), London to Stevenage (Thameslink), Stevenage to Huntingdon (Thameslink), taking about 16 hours.
This gave me quite a lot of time to think about trains.

There's a lot of complaint in the UK media that trains are expensive in the UK[^1].
This seems to stem from the fact the walk-on fares for long-distance trains are expensive.
However, advance fares are cheap.
People seem outraged by this, but I don't think it's an issue at all.
In fact, I think that it's a desirable pricing model that should make lower fares (i.e., advance fares) possible.

I think it's important to consider who the competitor of trains are.
At the commuter-level, such as the Thameslink trains I get regularly, the competitor is the car.
If there was no trains I would drive.
Driving has a fairly fixed price -- it costs me roughly the same to drive 50 miles.
These trains should be no different; they should be priced consistently.
However, at the long-distance, such as trains from London to Edinburgh, the competitor is flying.

Since the deregulation of the airlines in Britain and Ireland there has been a 50% reduction in air fares, and a doubling of passenger numbers[^2].
This has meant that you can get a cheap Ryanair or EasyJet flight from London to Edinburgh for as low as ¬£20[^3].
Trains are competing with this.
A quick check online shows that the price of a flight from London City to Edinburgh today is ¬£143.
Flights are priced dynamically, and are priced so that they are always full, but not over-booked.
Trains are priced much more statically, there is often lots of empty space and it is often overcrowded.
Long-distance trains should take inspiration from planes.
They should aim to fill, but not over-fill, every train.
They can do this by pricing cheap early on, giving affordable fares to leisure travellers, and then being expensive later on, primarily affecting business travellers -- exactly the same as flights.

There are examples of this throughout Europe.
The Eurostar follows this pricing model and most trains are full.
The TGV in France also follows a similar model.

Those calling for cheap flexible fares do not seem to realise that this will lead to more expensive inflexible fares.
Train companies want to be profitable, and even if they were nationalised, the state would want them to be profitable.
Dynamic pricing allows them to be profitable, while offering lower fares to those prepared to fix plans in advance.
This perception of expensive fares leads people to call for the nationalisation of the railways[^4].
I don't see how nationalisation would help.
Unless we were willing to massively subsidise rail fares (*spoiler: we're not*), then the fares would be roughly the same.
Some will want the state to subsidise long-distance rail travel.
However, I don't see why subsidising leisure travel or business travel is a good use of taxpayer's money.
The only one I think it would make sense to subsidise would be commuter rail travel, so that we can encourage less car commuting.
The reason for this is simple, long-distance rail travel is often a choice, commuting is not.

I think the deregulation of the railway, particularly under the [fourth railway package](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/4th-railway-package/) in the EU, could lead the way in creating a truly competitive market for train travel, similar to the airlines.
A couple of great examples are the TGV OuiGo, provided by the French national operator SNCF.
In anticipation of the opening of the French railway market, SNCF introduced a low-cost service, similar to Ryanair on rails.
You have to pay to book seats and book luggage, but this allows them to offer *cheap* fares, starting at just ‚Ç¨10.
Another great example is Flixtrain, a German open-access operator offering long-distance railway services primarily in Germany.
It offers slightly slower trains than the Intercity Express (ICE), at a fraction of the cost.
It does this by avoiding the high-speed rail lines with expensive access fees.
Closer to home, Lumo, an open-access operator going from London to Edinburgh with a no-frills service (imagine a slightly better Ryanair), offers fares at a fraction of the cost of the state-owned LNER full-service train (imagine British Airways).

So, to circle back, I think when we talk about trains in the UK, and Europe more generally, we should remember that it's really two different forms of travel, used for different purposes.
The first being commuter trains, that, perhaps, have no natural competitors, that should be fixed-fare and affordable, to encourage users away from the car.
The second being long-distance travel, where there is lots of demand between major cities, and perhaps additional demand could be induced from cities to holiday destinations (e.g., ski trains from London to the Alps).
These journeys should be priced dynamically, rewarding those who book in advance, while charging the most to business travellers who need short-notice flexible travel.
With these long-distance trains, we should aim to have every train full and price it accordingly.
An empty seat is losing money.

I look forward to the day when I'll be able to get a high-speed train all the way from London to Vienna at a smooth 300km/h, arriving in under 5 hours.
If this was possible, it would make planes in Europe almost redundant.
How great would that be?
